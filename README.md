Notes
===========================
As of right now:
COMMUNICATION DOES NOT WORK.
It just compiles and shows its pretty UI.

I would like to maintain compatibility between this and old versions, 
while adding more for the future. That said, While there are no errors during
compilation or in operation it cant communicate, neither with old versions nor
with itself.
Any wizards out there who can help?

How to compile LAN Messenger on Windows
============================
This project was compiled on Windows 11 with;
Qt Creator 18.0.1   (C:\Qt\)
Qt 6.10.1 MinGW 64 bit
Win64OpenSSL-3.6.0  (C:\Qt\Tools\OpenSSL-Win64)

Notes
============================
Most of the old project was borked so I started by removing some dead weight.
Obviously, we will need some of those back (Like the setup scripts.)
