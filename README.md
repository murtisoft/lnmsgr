Notes
===========================
Communication is fixed. WOHOO!

Right now this can communicate both with new and old versions. Happy new year!

I would like to maintain compatibility between this and old versions, 
while adding more in the future. 

How to compile LAN Messenger on Windows
============================
This project was compiled on Windows 11 with;

Qt Creator 18.0.1   (C:\Qt\)

Qt 6.10.1 MinGW 64 bit

Win64OpenSSL-3.6.0  (C:\Qt\Tools\OpenSSL-Win64)


Footnotes
============================
Most of the old project was borked so I started by removing some dead weight.
Obviously, we will need some of those back (Like the setup scripts.)
